# VCLA Autonomous Vehicles in _GTA V_

## Quick Start

Please install the provided conda environment with the following command:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To label data generated by the GTA V trainer, do the following commands:

```
$ cd data_labeler
$ python label_data.py /path/to/GTAV_program/drivedata/
```

Results will appear in /path/to/GTAV_program/drivedata/results/.
Please see the **Contents** section for advanced usage.

## Contents

### data_labeler

- `label_data.py`

  - should be the only script you need to run
  - if something goes wrong, try running the following scripts in the order they are shown, except `graph_coords.py`
  - creates labeled pickle files, putting them into GTAV_program/drivedata/results
  - if the --parent flag is set, the script expects the following directory structure:

    ```
    ~> /path/to/root_folder/
      |-- child_folder_1
      |   | -- *.csv
      |   | -- RGB_whole.raw
      |-- ...
      |-- child_folder_n
      |   | -- *.csv
      |   | -- RGB_whole.raw
    ```

  - **Sample output**

    ```

- `generate_pickles.py`

  - creates .pkl files from GTAV_program/drivedata/RGB_whole.raw
  - puts them into GTAV_program/drivedata/pickles
  - can take a long time before the progress bar is shown if the RGB_whole.raw file is very large

- `generate_visuals.py`

  - creates .jpg and/or .avi files from GTAV_program/drivedata/pickles/\*.pkl
  - puts them into GTAV_program/drivedata/imvid

- `crop_images.py`

  - crops the .jpg files in GTAV_program/drivedata/imvid/\*.jpg
  - puts them into GTAV_program/drivedata/crop
  - assumes a motorcycle as viewed in 3rd person mode

- `parse_turns.py`

  - parse the turns based on data in GTAV_program/drivedata/\*.csv and the .jpg files in GTAV_program/drivedata/crop
  - generates pkl files and puts them in GTAV_program/drivedata/results
  - the pkl files are five frames formatted as Numpy arrays, followed by an array indicating the key presses
  - key presses are formatted like \[A, D, W, S\]

- `graph_coords.py`

  - displays a graphical representation of the coordinates in GTAV_program/drivedata/\*.csv

- `test_results.py`
  - unpickles the results in GTAV_program/drivedata/results
  - uses cv2 to show the images and predicted keys

## To Do

- [x] Parse drivedata CSV files
- [x] Test on Windows
- [x] Train YOLOv3 model to determine braking/not-braking
- [ ] Figure out why cv2.imshow has a GTK error on my machine
- [ ] Run YOLOv3 model on cropped images to detect braking
- [ ] Change `parse_turns.py` to print out keys

## Further Notes

- YOLOv3 model trained with [Darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)
- My forked version with changes to auto-label data is [here](https://github.com/jasonjewik/darknet)
- Image annotations done with [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)
